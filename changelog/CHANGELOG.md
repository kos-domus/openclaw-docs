### Daily knowledge base run

No session files with `status: ready` were found under `sessions/`, so no Diátaxis docs required content merges today.

### Upstream consistency check

- Checked installed CLI version with `openclaw --version`: `2026.4.8`
- Checked upstream latest release with GitHub and npm: `2026.4.9`
- Confirmed `docs/meta/upstream-version.yaml` now tracks upstream `2026.4.9` with `last_check: 2026-04-10`
- Recorded upstream summary in `docs/meta/upstream-updates/2026-04-10-v2026.4.9.md`

### Relevant upstream notes for 2026.4.9

- New grounded memory/dreaming backfill and improved diary tooling
- Better provider auth aliasing and auth-profile persistence
- Stronger browser and `.env` security hardening
- Safer remote node exec event sanitization
- Better cron and agent timeout behavior
- Session routing and reply-token leakage fixes across external channels

### Self-assessment

Run completed cleanly. No session backlog existed, upstream was checked properly, and the repo was updated with the new upstream summary plus version-tracker refresh. Main follow-up: consider upgrading the local OpenClaw install from `2026.4.8` to `2026.4.9`.

### Upstream consistency check

- Checked installed CLI version with `openclaw --version`: `2026.4.8`
- Checked upstream latest release with GitHub and npm: `2026.4.10`
- Confirmed `docs/meta/upstream-version.yaml` now tracks upstream `2026.4.10` with `last_check: 2026-04-11`
- Recorded upstream summary in `docs/meta/upstream-updates/2026-04-11-v2026.4.10.md`
- Local install is still behind upstream by two releases (`2026.4.9` and `2026.4.10`)

### Relevant upstream notes for 2026.4.9 and 2026.4.10

- `2026.4.9` added grounded memory and diary improvements, better auth aliasing, stronger browser and `.env` hardening, safer remote exec event handling, and better cron/session routing behavior
- `2026.4.10` added the bundled Codex provider path, the optional Active Memory plugin, `openclaw exec-policy`, remote `commands.list`, and experimental MLX speech support on macOS
- `2026.4.10` also ships broad security hardening across browser, exec, plugins, gateway startup, cron reliability, and multi-channel thread routing

### Self-assessment

Run completed cleanly. There was no session backlog to elaborate, upstream tracking is now current, and the changelog captures the newly missed upstream release plus the local version gap. Main follow-up: upgrade the local OpenClaw install from `2026.4.8` to at least `2026.4.10` and smoke-test ACP/Codex, cron, and browser-related flows.
