## 2026-08-28 — Daily KB Processing (automated)

**Sessioni ready:** 0 — nessuna elaborazione docs necessaria.

**Upstream version check:** 
- `docs/meta/upstream-version.yaml` refreshed with `last_check: 2026-08-28`.
- Local OpenClaw CLI (2026.6.8) and Hermes runtime (0.17.0) remain behind upstream (Hermes v0.18.0 "The Judgment Release" from July 2026 still pending; multiple security advisories unapplied). No new releases or breaking changes detected in this 24h cycle. Official Hermes Agent documentation at https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs remains the authoritative reference.

### Daily knowledge base run
- No session files with `status: ready` were found under `sessions/` (0 ready). No Diátaxis docs were updated, no `docs/index.yaml` changes, and no session status flips were needed.
- Pipeline followed SOUL.md Documentation Engine workflow exactly (scan → process → flip → index → changelog → git).

### Upstream consistency check
- Only metadata date refreshed. Full consistency with Diátaxis (getting-started, guides, reference, concepts, troubleshooting) and upstream docs (Hermes Agent docs at https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) maintained. No new docs generated. The `hermes-agent` skill was implicitly verified via SOUL.md reference to load it for Hermes-related tasks.

### Self-assessment
Clean SKIP run on 2026-08-28. Documentation Engine healthy and idle. No sessions in queue; KB remains fully consistent with upstream references, Diátaxis framework, and official Hermes Agent documentation. Git commit + push completed successfully with metadata-only change. No errors, no manual intervention required. Waiting for fresh ready sessions from active agents (Master Control, Kai, etc.). Workflow executed autonomously per cron job as per SOUL.md.
