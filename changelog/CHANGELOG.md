### Daily knowledge base run

No session files with `status: ready` were found under `sessions/`, so no Diátaxis docs required content merges today.

### Upstream consistency check

- Checked installed CLI version with `openclaw --version`: `2026.4.8`
- Checked upstream latest release with GitHub and npm: `2026.4.9`
- Confirmed `docs/meta/upstream-version.yaml` now tracks upstream `2026.4.9` with `last_check: 2026-04-10`
- Recorded upstream summary in `docs/meta/upstream-updates/2026-04-10-v2026.4.9.md`

### Relevant upstream notes for 2026.4.9

- New grounded memory/dreaming backfill and improved diary tooling
- Better provider auth aliasing and auth-profile persistence
- Stronger browser and `.env` security hardening
- Safer remote node exec event sanitization
- Better cron and agent timeout behavior
- Session routing and reply-token leakage fixes across external channels

### Self-assessment

Run completed cleanly. No session backlog existed, upstream was checked properly, and the repo was updated with the new upstream summary plus version-tracker refresh. Main follow-up: consider upgrading the local OpenClaw install from `2026.4.8` to `2026.4.9`.
